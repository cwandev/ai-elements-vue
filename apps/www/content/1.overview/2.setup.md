Installing AI Elements is straightforward and can be done in a couple of ways. You can use the dedicated CLI command for the fastest setup, or integrate via the standard shadcn-vue CLI if you’ve already adopted shadcn’s workflow.

:pm-x{command="ai-elements-vue@latest"}

## Prerequisites

Before installing AI Elements, make sure your environment meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), version 18 or later
- A [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) project with the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) installed.
- [shadcn-vue](https://shadcn-vue.com/) installed in your project. In practice, this means you have already initialized shadcn-vue in your project (for example by running `npx shadcn-vue@latest init` and configuring Tailwind CSS). AI Elements currently supports only the CSS Variables mode of shadcn-vue for theming.
- We also highly recommend using the [AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) and adding `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` to your `env.local` so you don't have to use an API key from every provider. AI Gateway also gives $5 in usage per month so you can experiment with models. You can obtain an API key [here](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai%2Fapi-keys&title=Get%20your%20AI%20Gateway%20key).

## Installing Components

You can install AI Elements Vue components using either the AI Elements Vue CLI or the shadcn-vue CLI. Both achieve the same result: adding the selected component’s code and any needed dependencies to your project.

The CLI will download the component’s code and integrate it into your project’s directory (usually under your components folder). By default, AI Elements components are added to the `@/components/ai-elements/` directory (or whatever folder you’ve configured in your shadcn-vue components settings).

After running the command, you should see a confirmation in your terminal that the files were added. You can then proceed to use the component in your code.
